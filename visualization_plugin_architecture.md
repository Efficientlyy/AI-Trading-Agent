# Visualization Plugin Architecture Design

## Overview

The Visualization Plugin is a modular component for the System Overseer that provides real-time chart visualization capabilities for cryptocurrency trading pairs. This document outlines the architecture, interfaces, and implementation strategy for the plugin.

## Design Goals

1. **Modularity**: Seamless integration with the existing plugin framework
2. **Extensibility**: Support for multiple chart types and indicators
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live data visualization with minimal latency
4. **Asset Support**: Initial focus on BTC, ETH, and SOL trading pairs
5. **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to different display sizes and devices

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Components

#### VisualizationPlugin Class
- Main plugin class that implements the required plugin interface
- Manages the lifecycle of visualization components
- Handles communication with the System Overseer

#### DataProvider Interface
- Abstract interface for retrieving market data
- Implementations for different data sources (MEXC, historical data, etc.)
- Standardized data format for consumption by visualization components

#### ChartManager
- Manages multiple chart instances
- Handles chart creation, updates, and disposal
- Provides a unified interface for chart operations

### 2. Visualization Components

#### BaseChart
- Abstract base class for all chart types
- Defines common properties and methods
- Handles basic rendering and data binding

#### Chart Types
- CandlestickChart: Traditional OHLC visualization
- LineChart: Simple price movement visualization
- DepthChart: Order book visualization
- VolumeChart: Trading volume visualization

#### Indicators
- MovingAverage: Simple and exponential moving averages
- RSI: Relative Strength Index
- MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- Bollinger Bands: Volatility bands

### 3. Integration Points

#### System Overseer Integration
- Plugin registration with the PluginManager
- Access to system services (ConfigRegistry, EventBus)
- Event-based communication for real-time updates

#### Telegram Bot Integration
- Commands for requesting and managing charts
- Image generation and delivery via Telegram
- Interactive chart configuration

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Real-time market data is fetched from exchange APIs
   - Historical data is retrieved from local storage or APIs
   - Data is normalized to a standard format

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Raw market data is processed into chart-ready format
   - Technical indicators are calculated
   - Data is filtered based on timeframe and user preferences

3. **Visualization**:
   - Processed data is bound to chart components
   - Charts are rendered as images or interactive elements
   - Rendered charts are delivered to the user interface

4. **User Interaction**:
   - User requests specific charts or configurations
   - System responds with appropriate visualizations
   - User can modify parameters for custom views

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement VisualizationPlugin class with basic plugin lifecycle
- Create DataProvider interface and MEXC implementation
- Develop ChartManager with basic chart creation capabilities

### Phase 2: Core Charts
- Implement CandlestickChart for OHLC visualization
- Add LineChart for simple price tracking
- Create basic image rendering capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD)
- Implement DepthChart for order book visualization
- Add multi-timeframe support

### Phase 4: Integration
- Connect with Telegram Bot for chart delivery
- Implement interactive chart configuration
- Add chart caching for performance optimization

## Configuration Options

```json
{
  "visualization": {
    "default_pairs": ["BTCUSDC", "ETHUSDC", "SOLUSDC"],
    "default_timeframe": "1h",
    "chart_types": ["candlestick", "line"],
    "indicators": ["sma", "ema", "rsi"],
    "auto_refresh": true,
    "refresh_interval": 60
  }
}
```

## Plugin Interface

```python
class VisualizationPlugin:
    """Visualization Plugin for System Overseer."""
    
    def initialize(self, system_core):
        """Initialize plugin with system core."""
        pass
    
    def start(self):
        """Start plugin operation."""
        pass
    
    def stop(self):
        """Stop plugin operation."""
        pass
    
    def get_chart(self, symbol, chart_type, timeframe, indicators=None):
        """Get chart for specified parameters."""
        pass
    
    def get_available_charts(self):
        """Get list of available chart configurations."""
        pass
```

## Conclusion

The Visualization Plugin architecture provides a flexible, extensible framework for adding chart visualization capabilities to the System Overseer. By following a modular design approach, the plugin can be easily extended with new chart types, indicators, and data sources while maintaining compatibility with the existing system.

The implementation strategy allows for incremental development and testing, with each phase building upon the previous one to deliver increasing functionality. The plugin will enhance the System Overseer's capabilities by providing visual insights into market conditions and trading performance.
