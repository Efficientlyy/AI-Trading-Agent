# Dashboard Usability Testing Guide

This guide outlines the structured approach for testing the dashboard usability with a focus on performance metrics visualization and alerting.

## Testing Objectives

1. Validate information hierarchy and visualization clarity
2. Assess user experience in different scenarios
3. Identify missing metrics or visualizations
4. Validate alert notification effectiveness
5. Measure time-to-insight for critical performance issues

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- WSL2 environment properly configured per the WSL2_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Docker and Docker Compose installed and functional
- All services deployed using the docker-compose.simple.v2.yml configuration
- Performance metrics being generated via the integration_test.rs scenarios

### Test Environment Preparation

```powershell
# Start all services with performance metrics enabled
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.v2.yml up -d

# Run performance tests to generate metrics data
cd market-data-processor
cargo test --package market-data-processor --test baseline_test -- --nocapture
cargo test --package market-data-processor --test integration_test -- --nocapture
```

## User Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Dashboard Overview and Navigation

**Objective**: Evaluate the overall dashboard layout, navigation, and information hierarchy

**Tasks for Testers**:
1. Navigate to the Grafana dashboard at http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with the default credentials (admin/trading123)
3. Locate and open the Trading Performance dashboard
4. Identify the key performance metrics sections
5. Navigate between different time ranges (last hour, last day, last week)
6. Use dashboard variables to filter by trading pair if available

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Time to find specific metrics (measured in seconds)
- Number of clicks required to access critical information
- User satisfaction rating (1-5 scale)
- Comments on information grouping and organization

### Scenario 2: Performance Issue Identification

**Objective**: Assess how quickly users can identify and diagnose performance issues

**Setup**:
1. Use the regression_detection test to simulate performance degradation
2. Ensure alerts are triggered for at least:
   - High order execution latency
   - Low market data throughput
   - High CPU usage

**Tasks for Testers**:
1. Open the Trading Performance dashboard
2. Identify which components are experiencing performance issues
3. Determine the severity of each issue
4. Navigate to detailed metrics for the problematic components
5. Suggest possible causes based on the visualizations

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Time to identify all performance issues
- Accuracy of issue identification (%)
- Accuracy of severity assessment (%)
- Quality of diagnostic insights (1-5 scale)

### Scenario 3: Alert Notification and Response

**Objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness of alert notifications and response workflow

**Setup**:
1. Configure email or Slack notifications in Grafana
2. Trigger various performance alerts
3. Ensure notification channels are working

**Tasks for Testers**:
1. Monitor for alert notifications
2. Navigate from notification to relevant dashboard
3. Acknowledge the alert
4. Follow troubleshooting steps from the documentation
5. Resolve the simulated issue

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Time from alert trigger to user awareness
- Time from notification to accessing relevant dashboard
- Clarity of alert information (1-5 scale)
- Effectiveness of recommended actions (1-5 scale)

### Scenario 4: Dashboard Customization and Exploration

**Objective**: Assess how effectively users can customize and explore performance data

**Tasks for Testers**:
1. Create a custom dashboard panel for a specific metric
2. Modify time ranges to explore historical performance patterns
3. Create a dashboard variable for filtering by component
4. Export dashboard data for offline analysis
5. Create a custom alert threshold

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Success rate of customization tasks (%)
- Time to complete each customization task
- User confidence in customization abilities (1-5 scale)
- Suggestions for additional customization options

## Usability Testing Template

For each tester, use the following structured template to collect feedback:

```

## Post-Testing Analysis

After collecting feedback from at least 5 testers, analyze the results to identify:

1. **Common Pain Points**:
   - Features or workflows with consistently low ratings
   - Tasks that consistently took longer than expected
   - Information that was difficult to find or interpret

2. **Missing Metrics**:
   - Compile a list of all suggested missing metrics
   - Prioritize based on frequency of mention and criticality

3. **Information Hierarchy Improvements**:
   - Identify optimal grouping of metrics based on user feedback
   - Determine most effective layout for quick issue identification

4. **Alert Refinements**:
   - Optimize alert thresholds based on user feedback
   - Improve notification content and format
   - Enhance troubleshooting guidance

## Implementation Plan

Based on usability testing results, create an implementation plan that includes:

1. **Dashboard Refinements**:
   - Panel layout optimization
   - Information grouping improvements
   - Color scheme and visual hierarchy enhancements

2. **Metric Additions**:
   - Implementation of missing critical metrics
   - Enhanced visualizations for existing metrics

3. **Alert Optimizations**:
   - Threshold adjustments
   - Notification format improvements
   - Integration with additional notification channels

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Dashboard user guide revisions
   - Alert response playbook enhancements

## Integration with Continuous Improvement

Establish a process for ongoing dashboard usability improvement:

1. **Regular Usability Testing**:
   - Schedule quarterly usability testing sessions
   - Rotate testers to get diverse perspectives

2. **Feedback Collection**:
