## Signal Details for SOLUSDC

```json
{
  "type": "SELL",
  "source": "order_imbalance",
  "strength": 0.7889987853548499,
  "timestamp": 1749073559306,
  "price": 155.3409,
  "symbol": "SOLUSDC",
  "session": "US"
}
```

## Error Analysis

The primary error observed was:
```
Exception fetching klines for [SYMBOL]: '[SYMBOL]'
```

This suggests that the MEXC API is rejecting the symbol format being used. The system is correctly standardizing symbols across components, but the API may require a different format or the trading pairs may not be available on MEXC.

## Next Steps

1. Verify symbol availability on MEXC exchange
2. Test with alternative symbol formats (e.g., BTC-USDT instead of BTC/USDC)
3. Implement more robust error handling for unavailable symbols
4. Consider adding support for alternative exchanges if MEXC doesn't support these trading pairs
