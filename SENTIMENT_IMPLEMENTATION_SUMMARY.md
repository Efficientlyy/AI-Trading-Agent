## Usage Example

```python
# Basic sentiment analysis
import asyncio
from src.analysis_agents.sentiment.nlp_service import NLPService
from src.analysis_agents.sentiment.social_media_sentiment import TwitterClient, RedditClient

async def analyze_bitcoin_sentiment():
    # Initialize services
    nlp = NLPService()
    await nlp.initialize()
    
    twitter = TwitterClient(api_key="...", api_secret="...", access_token="...", access_secret="...")
    
    # Get tweets about Bitcoin
    tweets = await twitter.search_tweets(query="#BTC OR $BTC", count=100)
    
    # Analyze sentiment
    sentiment_scores = await nlp.analyze_sentiment(tweets)
    avg_sentiment = sum(sentiment_scores) / len(sentiment_scores)
    
    print(f"Bitcoin sentiment: {avg_sentiment:.2f}")
    
    # Generate trading signal
    if avg_sentiment > 0.7:
        print("SIGNAL: BUY - Strongly bullish sentiment")
    elif avg_sentiment < 0.3:
        print("SIGNAL: SELL - Strongly bearish sentiment")
    else:
        print("SIGNAL: NEUTRAL - No clear sentiment direction")

# Run the analysis
asyncio.run(analyze_bitcoin_sentiment())
```

The sentiment analysis system is now ready for integration with the AI trading agent's core decision-making process.
