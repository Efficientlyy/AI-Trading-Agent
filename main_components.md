# Trading-Agent Project: Main Components Analysis

## System Architecture Overview

Based on the repository analysis, the Trading-Agent project is an ultra-fast flash trading system designed for the MEXC exchange, with a focus on zero-fee trading pairs (BTCUSDC, ETHUSDC). The system follows a modular architecture with six distinct layers:

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**: Handles market data from MEXC and external sources
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Processes and stores market data
3. **Signal Generation Layer**: Analyzes data to generate trading signals
4. **Decision Making Layer**: Makes trading decisions based on signals
5. **Execution Layer**: Executes trades and manages positions
6. **Visualization Layer**: Provides interactive dashboards and visualizations
