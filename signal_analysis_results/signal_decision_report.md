- **Symbols Analyzed:** BTCUSDC, ETHUSDC
- **Total Signals Generated:** 0
- **Total Trading Decisions:** 0

## Executive Summary

During the test period, no trading signals were generated. This could be due to:

1. Current market conditions not meeting the configured thresholds
2. Conservative signal generation parameters
3. Insufficient test duration for proper market analysis

Consider adjusting signal thresholds or running tests during more volatile market periods.

## Market Conditions

### Market State Summary

| Symbol | Bid Price | Ask Price | Spread (bps) | Order Imbalance | Momentum | Volatility |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| BTCUSDC | 104737.5 | 104749.93 | 1.1867060472309021 | 0.3978 | -0.0000 | 0.0000 |

## Signal Analysis

No signals were generated during the test period.

## Trading Decision Analysis

No trading decisions were made during the test period.

## Recommendations

Based on the lack of signals during the test period, we recommend:

1. **Adjust Signal Thresholds**: Consider lowering the thresholds for signal generation to increase sensitivity.
   - Current imbalance thresholds (0.08-0.12) could be reduced to 0.05-0.08
   - Current volatility thresholds (0.03-0.05) could be reduced to 0.02-0.03
   - Current momentum thresholds (0.02-0.03) could be reduced to 0.01-0.02

2. **Extended Testing**: Run tests during more volatile market periods or for longer durations.

3. **Additional Signal Sources**: Implement additional signal sources such as technical indicators or sentiment analysis.

## Conclusion

The Trading-Agent system is technically sound but requires threshold adjustments to generate signals in the current market conditions. The system successfully connects to the exchange API, retrieves market data, and processes it correctly, but the current signal generation thresholds may be too conservative for the observed market volatility.

With the recommended threshold adjustments and extended testing, the system should begin generating trading signals and provide valuable insights into its decision-making capabilities.
