## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the frontend of the MEXC trading system. By following this plan, the development team can ensure that the system is built incrementally, with each step building on the previous ones.

The focus on core functionality first—real-time market data display, professional charting, and essential trading interface—ensures that the system will provide value early in the development process. The clear permission boundaries and explicit approval requirements will help maintain control over the development process and prevent scope creep.

Regular testing and validation throughout the process will ensure that the system meets the required quality standards and provides an excellent user experience.
