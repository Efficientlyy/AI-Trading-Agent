   - Order queue management

2. **Risk Management Framework**
   - Automatic stop-loss placement
   - Take-profit management
   - Maximum drawdown protection
   - Position correlation analysis
   - Exposure limits by timeframe

3. **Execution Optimization**
   - Slippage reduction techniques
   - Latency optimization
   - Order splitting for large positions
   - Retry mechanisms for failed orders

### Phase 4: Performance & Monitoring (2 weeks)
1. **Real-time Performance Dashboard**
   - Strategy performance metrics
   - Trade history and analysis
   - Drawdown visualization
   - Profit/loss tracking

2. **System Monitoring**
   - API connectivity status
   - Order execution latency
   - Signal generation performance
   - Error rate tracking

3. **Alerting System**
   - Performance threshold alerts
   - Risk limit notifications
   - Technical failure warnings
   - Market condition alerts

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Enhancements
1. **Data Processing Optimization**
   - Implement efficient data structures for rapid analysis
   - Optimize WebSocket connection management
   - Add data caching for frequently used calculations
   - Implement parallel processing for indicator calculation

2. **Database Integration**
   - Store historical trades and performance
   - Cache market data for backtesting
   - Maintain strategy configurations
   - Track system performance metrics

### Frontend Improvements
1. **Interactive Strategy Builder**
   - Visual strategy creation interface
   - Drag-and-drop indicator selection
   - Parameter adjustment sliders
   - Strategy testing visualization

2. **Advanced Charting**
   - Multi-timeframe synchronized charts
   - Drawing tools persistence
   - Indicator overlay management
   - Trade entry/exit markers

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement core technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
2. Create basic signal generation for 1m chart based on indicator crossovers
3. Develop simple backtesting functionality to validate strategies
4. Add manual strategy activation controls to the UI

### Short-term Goals (3-4 weeks)
1. Complete the technical indicator suite with advanced pattern recognition
2. Implement automated signal generation for both 1m and 15m timeframes
3. Develop basic execution engine with risk management controls
4. Create performance tracking dashboard

### Medium-term Goals (2-3 months)
1. Implement machine learning integration for adaptive trading
2. Develop full execution optimization suite
3. Create comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
4. Optimize system for minimal latency

## Risk Considerations
1. **Market Risks**
   - Flash crashes and extreme volatility
   - Liquidity gaps in fast-moving markets
   - Correlation breakdowns during market stress

2. **Technical Risks**
   - API rate limiting and throttling
   - WebSocket disconnections
   - Order execution delays
   - System performance under high load

3. **Operational Risks**
   - Strategy logic errors
   - Parameter optimization overfitting
   - Signal false positives/negatives

## Conclusion
Transforming the current MEXC Trading Dashboard into a fully automated flash trading system requires systematic implementation of technical indicators, signal generation algorithms, execution engine, and performance monitoring. By following this phased approach, the system can be incrementally enhanced while maintaining stability and reliability.

The foundation is already in place with the real-time data infrastructure and professional UI. The next critical step is implementing technical indicators and basic signal generation to begin the transformation into an automated trading system.
