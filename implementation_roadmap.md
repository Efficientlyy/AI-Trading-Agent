### 5.3 Deployment Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)
| Enhancement | Implementation Details | Technical Requirements | Priority |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Paper Trading Mode** | Implement paper trading for strategy validation | Simulated execution, performance tracking | High |
| **Gradual Deployment System** | Create system for gradual capital allocation | Capital allocation logic, performance monitoring | High |
| **Environment Configuration** | Set up production, staging, and development environments | Environment management, configuration | Medium |
| **Deployment Automation** | Implement automated testing and deployment | CI/CD pipeline, automated testing | Medium |

```python
# deployment_manager.py (new file)
class DeploymentManager:
    def __init__(self, config_path):
        self.config = self._load_config(config_path)
        self.environments = {
            "development": {"capital_allocation": 0},
            "paper_trading": {"capital_allocation": 0},
            "production": {"capital_allocation": 0}
        }
        
    def _load_config(self, config_path):
        # Load configuration from file
        
    def start_paper_trading(self, strategy, initial_allocation):
        # Start paper trading for strategy
        
    def evaluate_paper_trading(self, strategy, min_days=30):
        # Evaluate paper trading performance
        
    def allocate_capital(self, strategy, environment, amount):
        # Allocate capital to strategy in environment
        
    def promote_to_production(self, strategy, initial_allocation_pct=10):
        # Promote strategy to production with initial allocation

## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for enhancing the Trading-Agent system based on expert recommendations. By following this phased approach, the system will evolve from a basic technical analysis engine to a sophisticated trading platform with advanced signal generation, AI/ML components, market awareness, optimized execution, and robust evaluation capabilities.

The plan prioritizes enhancements that provide the highest impact with reasonable implementation complexity, while ensuring that each phase builds logically on the previous one. Regular evaluation and testing throughout the implementation process will ensure that the system maintains high performance and reliability as new features are added.
