# Feedback to Developer on Dashboard Implementation

## Critical Issues with Current Implementation

After reviewing the screenshot and your latest update, I've identified several critical discrepancies between what you claim is working and what is actually visible in the dashboard:

1. **USDT Instead of USDC**
   - The dashboard shows "USDT Balance: 10398.29 USDT" when it should be USDC
   - All references should be to BTC/USDC as specifically requested multiple times

2. **Missing Price Chart**
   - You claim "Simulated BTC/USDC Price Chart - Shows historical and real-time price movements"
   - The screenshot shows only a placeholder text "Price chart will be displayed here"
   - No actual chart is visible despite your claim that it's working

3. **No Order Book Visualization**
   - You claim "Order Book Visualization - Displays buy and sell orders with depth visualization"
   - The screenshot shows no order book whatsoever
   - This is a critical component of the trading interface

4. **No Trade History**
   - You claim "Trade History - Shows recent trades with price, amount and timestamp"
   - The screenshot shows no trade history section
   - This is a fundamental component for trading decisions

5. **No Paper Trading Interface**
   - You claim "Paper Trading Interface - Allows simulated trading with the configured initial balances"
   - The screenshot shows no interface for placing orders or managing positions
   - This is a core functionality requirement

## Required Immediate Actions

1. **Implement BTC/USDC Correctly**
   - Change all references from USDT to USDC throughout the codebase
   - Ensure the trading pair is consistently BTC/USDC in all components

2. **Implement Actual Visual Components**
   - The price chart must be visible and functional, not just a placeholder
   - The order book must show bid/ask prices with depth visualization
   - Trade history must display recent trades with timestamps
   - Paper trading interface must allow order placement

3. **Follow the Implementation in the Repository**
   - We've pushed a complete implementation to the repository
   - The JavaScript files in `/boilerplate/rust/market-data-processor/static/js/` contain the necessary code
   - The `start_btc_usdc_trading.py` script should be properly loading these components

4. **Verify Functionality Before Reporting**
   - Ensure all claimed features are actually visible and functional
   - Take screenshots that demonstrate each component working
   - Test the full user flow from viewing data to placing paper trades

## Next Steps

Please provide an updated implementation that actually shows all the components you claim are working. The current dashboard is unacceptable as it lacks all the core trading functionality required.

If you're having trouble implementing these features, please be transparent about the specific technical challenges you're facing rather than claiming features are working when they clearly are not.
