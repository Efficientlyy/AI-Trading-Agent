- [ ] Create historical sentiment data collection and storage
- [ ] Implement sentiment signal validation against price action
- [ ] Add detailed logging for debugging and performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize cache management for memory efficiency

### Frontend Enhancements
- [ ] Create a dedicated sentiment dashboard component
- [ ] Add historical sentiment trend visualization
- [ ] Implement real-time sentiment signal notifications
- [ ] Develop sentiment heatmap for monitored assets
- [ ] Add detailed signal inspection modal/view

### Agent Flow Grid Visualization
- [ ] Implement sub-component visualization for SentimentAnalysisAgent (Alpha Vantage Client, Sentiment Processor, Signal Generator, Cache Manager)
- [ ] Add animated data flow paths showing sentiment data processing pipeline
- [ ] Create real-time signal indicators on agent connections (signal type, strength, confidence, age)
- [ ] Enhance AgentCard with "Detailed View" for sentiment metrics and mini charts
- [ ] Implement interactive elements to inspect data flowing between agents

## Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

### Multi-Source Sentiment Integration
- [ ] Add Twitter/X API integration for social sentiment
- [ ] Implement Reddit API for community sentiment analysis
- [ ] Integrate additional news providers (beyond Alpha Vantage)
- [ ] Create weighted aggregation of sentiment across sources
- [ ] Implement source reliability scoring
- [ ] Add cryptocurrency-specific forums and communities

### Enhanced NLP Processing
- [ ] Implement named entity recognition for better context understanding
- [ ] Add topic modeling to categorize news by impact area
- [ ] Create sentiment target extraction (price vs. technology sentiment)
- [ ] Implement misinformation/fake news detection filters
- [ ] Add context-aware sentiment analysis
- [ ] Develop a custom financial sentiment lexicon

### Backtesting Framework
- [ ] Build sentiment signal backtesting infrastructure
- [ ] Implement signal accuracy and latency measurement
- [ ] Create visualization of historical sentiment vs. price
- [ ] Add benchmark comparisons to baseline strategies
- [ ] Develop optimized parameters based on historical data

## Long-Term Vision (3+ Months)

### Advanced Configuration UI
- [ ] Create user-friendly sentiment configuration panel
- [ ] Implement real-time adjustment of sentiment thresholds
- [ ] Add source selection and weighting options
- [ ] Develop custom topic configuration for each asset
- [ ] Create visual feedback on signal quality

### Predictive Sentiment Modeling
- [ ] Implement machine learning models to predict sentiment shifts
- [ ] Create sentiment-based leading indicators
- [ ] Model sentiment diffusion across different communities
- [ ] Build pattern recognition for narrative formation
- [ ] Develop sentiment seasonality analysis

### Cross-Agent Integration
- [ ] Create seamless integration with technical analysis signals
- [ ] Implement sentiment-augmented decision models
- [ ] Build combined sentiment-technical-fundamental signal aggregation
- [ ] Develop reinforcement learning for adaptive signal weighting
- [ ] Add explainability features for sentiment-based decisions

## Performance Metrics & KPIs

To measure the effectiveness of the SentimentAnalysisAgent, we'll track:

1. **Signal Accuracy Rate**: % of sentiment signals that correctly predict price direction
2. **Signal Lead Time**: How far in advance sentiment signals precede price movements
3. **API Efficiency**: Ratio of successful API calls to total signals generated
4. **Cache Utilization**: % of requests serviced from cache vs. live API calls
5. **Processing Time**: Average time to generate sentiment signals
6. **Error Rate**: % of processing attempts that result in errors
7. **Recovery Rate**: % of error situations that successfully used fallback mechanisms
8. **Signal Quality**: Confidence scores of generated signals

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to the SentimentAnalysisAgent:

1. Follow the error handling patterns established in the codebase
2. Maintain the caching mechanism for all new data sources
3. Update metrics tracking for any new functionality
4. Add appropriate unit tests for new features
5. Document configuration options and parameters
6. Ensure frontend visualizations are consistent with the overall design
7. Optimize for performance and API usage efficiency
