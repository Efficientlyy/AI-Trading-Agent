# Dashboard Architecture

This document outlines the modular architecture of the AI Trading Agent Dashboard, following the Single Responsibility Principle and maintaining files under 300 lines.

## Overview

The dashboard has been refactored from a monolithic implementation to a component-based architecture. This makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and extensible. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the system.

## Key Components

### 1. Modern Dashboard Application

**File**: `src/dashboard/modern_dashboard_refactored.py`

The main application that integrates all other components. Responsibilities:
- Flask and SocketIO server initialization
- Route registration
- API endpoint management
- User session management

### 2. Authentication Module

**File**: `src/dashboard/utils/auth.py`

Handles all aspects of user authentication and authorization. Features:
- User account management
- Password hashing and verification
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- Decorators for protected routes

### 3. Data Service Layer

**File**: `src/dashboard/utils/data_service.py`

Provides a clean abstraction for data access, supporting both mock and real data sources. Features:
- Intelligent caching with configurable expiry
- Seamless switching between mock and real data
- Fallback to mock data when real data is unavailable
- Unified data access interface

### 4. Mock Data Generator

**File**: `src/dashboard/utils/mock_data.py`

Generates realistic mock data for development and testing. Features:
- Realistic trading performance data
- System status and component health metrics
- Market regime indicators
- Order and execution simulations

### 5. Enums Module

**File**: `src/dashboard/utils/enums.py`

Centralizes all enumeration types used throughout the dashboard. Includes enums for:
- System operational states
- Trading activity states
- System operating modes
- User permission roles
- Data source options

### 6. Dashboard Runner

**File**: `run_modular_dashboard.py`

Launches the dashboard application with appropriate configuration. Features:
- Command-line argument parsing
- Automatic detection of available ports
- Graceful handling of port conflicts
- Directory structure verification
- Fallback to original implementation if needed

## Design Principles

The dashboard architecture adheres to the following design principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has one reason to change
2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Common functionality is abstracted into reusable components
3. **Separation of Concerns**: UI, authentication, data access, and business logic are separated
4. **File Size Limits**: All modules are kept under 300 lines for improved readability
5. **Clear Component Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between components
6. **Predictable Data Flow**: One-way data flow from data service to UI components

## Running the Dashboard

To run the modular dashboard:

```bash
python run_modular_dashboard.py
```

For additional options:

```bash
python run_modular_dashboard.py --help
```

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to the dashboard architecture:

1. **UI Component Modularization**: Further break down UI components into smaller, reusable pieces
2. **Database Integration**: Proper database storage for user accounts and settings
3. **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all API endpoints
4. **Real-time Analytics**: Enhanced real-time metrics and alerts
5. **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode and customizable theming
6. **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture for custom dashboard features
