Benchmark results comparing Rust vs Python implementations:

| Dataset Size | Python Time | Rust Time | Speedup |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 30 days      | 0.35s       | 0.01s     | 35x     |
| 90 days      | 1.02s       | 0.03s     | 34x     |
| 180 days     | 2.15s       | 0.06s     | 36x     |
| 365 days     | 4.42s       | 0.12s     | 37x     |
| 730 days     | 8.87s       | 0.14s     | 63x     |

### Key Performance Aspects

1. **Memory Efficiency**

- Need for Python bindings and fallback implementation

### Python Interface Design

**Decision**: Create a Pythonic API that mirrors common Python libraries.

**Rationale**:
- Familiar interface for Python developers
- Consistency with existing Python ecosystem
- Easier integration with Python-based strategies

**Trade-offs**:
- Some overhead in type conversions
- Cannot expose all Rust-specific optimizations
- Need to maintain Python fallback implementation

### Performance vs. Flexibility

**Decision**: Optimize for performance while maintaining flexibility.

**Rationale**:
- Backtesting often involves large datasets
- Fast iteration is critical for strategy development
- Need to support various order types and trading scenarios

**Trade-offs**:
- Some features add complexity
- Maintaining compatibility between Rust and Python versions
- Performance impact of supporting advanced features

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated before processing
   - Proper handling of malformed data
   - Protection against invalid parameter values

2. **Error Handling**
   - No sensitive information in error messages
   - Graceful failure without exposing internals
   - Proper logging of errors for debugging

3. **Resource Management**
   - Efficient resource allocation and cleanup
   - Protection against memory leaks
