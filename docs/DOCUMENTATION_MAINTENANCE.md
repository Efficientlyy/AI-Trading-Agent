# Documentation Maintenance Plan

This document outlines the practices and guidelines for maintaining documentation in the AI Trading Agent project.

## Documentation Practices

As developers working on this project, we commit to:

1. **Update Documentation with Code Changes**
   - Update relevant documentation files whenever code is modified
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system
   - Add documentation for new features before considering them complete

2. **Regular Documentation Reviews**
   - Conduct monthly reviews of all documentation
   - Check for outdated information, broken links, or unclear explanations
   - Update documentation based on user feedback and questions

3. **Documentation-First Approach**
   - Write documentation before implementing major features
   - Use documentation as a design tool to clarify requirements
   - Validate documentation with stakeholders before implementation

## Guidelines for All Developers

To ensure all team members maintain documentation quality, follow these guidelines:

### Documentation Standards

1. **File Organization**
   - Keep documentation in the `docs/` directory
   - Use clear, descriptive filenames
   - Group related documentation files together
   - Maintain a central index in README.md

2. **Content Structure**
   - Begin each document with a clear purpose statement
   - Use consistent headings and formatting
   - Include examples and code snippets where helpful
   - Add diagrams for complex concepts
   - End with related resources or next steps

3. **Writing Style**
   - Write in clear, concise language
   - Avoid jargon or explain it when necessary
   - Use active voice and present tense
   - Include both high-level overviews and detailed explanations

### Documentation Workflow

1. **When Adding Features**
   - Update or create documentation before submitting code for review
   - Include documentation changes in the same pull request as code changes
   - Reference documentation in commit messages

2. **When Fixing Bugs**
   - Update documentation to prevent similar issues
   - Add troubleshooting information if relevant
   - Document workarounds if permanent fixes aren't possible

3. **When Refactoring**
   - Update architecture documentation to reflect new structure
   - Document reasons for significant changes
   - Update examples to use new patterns or APIs

### Documentation Types to Maintain

1. **User Documentation**
   - Dashboard user guides
   - Feature explanations
   - Configuration options
   - Troubleshooting guides

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Architecture overviews
   - API documentation
   - Component interactions
   - Development setup guides

3. **Operational Documentation**
   - Deployment procedures
   - Monitoring guidelines
   - Backup and recovery processes
   - Security practices

## Dashboard Documentation

The modern dashboard is the primary interface for the AI Trading Agent. The following documentation files provide comprehensive information about the dashboard:

1. **MODERN_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md** - User guide for the modern dashboard
2. **DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical architecture of the dashboard
3. **DASHBOARD_REDESIGN_PLAN.md** - Future enhancement plans for the dashboard

Always refer to these documents when making changes to the dashboard, and update them accordingly.
