# Real Data Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing real data connections in the AI Trading Agent dashboard. The goal is to enable the dashboard to display real trading data, system metrics, and logs instead of mock data.

## Current Status (March 2025)

- Real data connections are **implemented** but disabled by default
- The dashboard includes a UI toggle for temporary switching between data sources
- The `enable_real_data.py` script provides command-line control for permanent configuration
- The Enhanced DataService is implemented with robust error handling, caching, and fallback mechanisms
- All Phase 1 components are completed
- Phase 2 is partially completed (4/8 components done)

## Usage

### Enabling Real Data Connections (Current Method)

To enable real data connections, run:

```bash
python enable_real_data.py enable
```

### Disabling Real Data Connections (Current Method)

To disable real data connections, run:

```bash
python enable_real_data.py disable
```

### Checking Real Data Status (Current Method)

To check the current status of real data connections, run:

```bash
python enable_real_data.py status
```

### Future Dashboard Method (Coming in Phase 2)

1. Open the dashboard
2. Click the Settings icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "Data Sources" from the settings menu
4. Toggle "Enable Real Data" to ON or OFF
5. Configure individual data sources as needed
6. Click "Save" to apply changes

## Dependencies

- `DataService`: Provides a unified interface for accessing data from different sources
- `PerformanceTracker`: Loads and processes trade data from `data/trades/` directory
- `SystemMonitor`: Monitors system health metrics
- `LogQuery`: Queries log files from `logs/` directory
- `ConfigManager`: Manages the real data configuration file
- `WebSocketManager`: (Future) Manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Known Issues

1. Real data toggle in dashboard only affects the current session, not persistent configuration
2. No UI exists for editing the `real_data_config.json` file
3. Error reporting could be more detailed for specific data source failures
4. Real data performance may be slower than mock data for certain operations

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 2 components according to the timeline
2. Address known issues
3. Begin preparation for Phase 3 implementation
4. Expand test coverage for new components
