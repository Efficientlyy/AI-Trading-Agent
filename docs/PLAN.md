# AI Trading Agent Rebuild Plan

## Dashboard & Trade Page Refactor Plan

To align with the modular, multi-agent architecture and provide a professional user experience, the dashboard and trading functionality will be split into dedicated pages. This separation enhances clarity, performance, and future scalability.

### 1. Page Responsibilities

**Dashboard Page (Overview & Monitoring):**
- ✅ Portfolio Summary (value, allocation, performance)
- ✅ Asset Allocation Chart (clickable, drill-down)
- ✅ Technical Analysis Chart (overview mode, key indicators)
- ✅ Sentiment Summary (signal strengths, news/social/fundamental signals)
- ✅ Recent Trades (latest trades, quick status)
- ✅ Notifications (alerts, errors, info)
- ✅ Quick Links (Trading, Backtesting, Strategies, Settings)

**Trade Page (Action & Execution):**
- ✅ Asset Selector (context-aware, defaults to asset clicked in dashboard)
- ✅ Live Price Chart (focused, trading indicators)
- ✅ Order Entry Form (buy/sell, order type, quantity, price, etc.)
- ✅ Order Book & Recent Trades (for selected asset)
- ✅ Open Orders & Order History (manage/cancel/view trades)
- ✅ Position Details (current position, P&L, risk for selected asset)
- ✅ Trade Confirmation & Feedback

### 2. File/Component Structure
- `/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — high-level monitoring/overview
- `/src/pages/Trade.tsx` — all trading-specific components and logic
- `/src/components/dashboard/` — PortfolioSummary, AssetAllocationChart, TechnicalChart, SentimentSummary, RecentTrades, Notifications, etc.
- `/src/components/trading/` — OrderEntryForm, OrderBook, TradeHistory, PositionDetails, AssetSelector, etc.

### 3. Routing
- Add `/dashboard` and `/trade` (or `/trading`) routes in `App.tsx`
- Pass selected asset as route state or via context

### 4. State & Context
- Use React Context or global state for:
  - Selected asset/symbol
  - Notifications/messages

### 5. E2E Test Updates
- Update Cypress tests for new navigation and page structure
- Test dashboard and trade page flows independently

### 6. Documentation
- Update PLAN.md to reflect:
  - Separation of concerns
  - Component locations
  - Rationale for the new structure

### Multi-Agent System
- **Specialized Agents:** Each agent analyzes a unique data stream or trading strategy (e.g., technical indicators, sentiment, news, fundamentals) and produces trading signals or insights.
- **Decision Agent:** Aggregates all agent signals, applies risk management and portfolio constraints, and determines final trading actions (buy/sell/hold, sizing, etc.).
- **Execution Layer:** Handles order placement, monitoring, and feedback to agents for learning and adaptation.

### Why This Approach?
- **Modularity:** Agents can be developed, tested, and improved independently.
- **Adaptivity:** New agents can be added as new data sources or strategies emerge.
- **Transparency:** The system can explain which signals led to a decision.
- **Robustness:** Reduces reliance on any single strategy or data stream.

The platform includes a modern dashboard for monitoring portfolio, agent signals, trades, and analytics, as well as dedicated pages for trading, backtesting, and strategy management.

## Overview
This document outlines the phased approach for rebuilding the AI Trading Agent with a focus on clean architecture, modern dashboard interface, and enhanced trading strategies.
