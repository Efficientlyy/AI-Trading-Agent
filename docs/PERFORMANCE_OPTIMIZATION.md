## Overview

The AI Trading Agent includes a comprehensive set of performance optimization utilities designed to improve efficiency, reduce latency, and enhance the overall user experience. These optimizations focus on:

1. **Reducing redundant computations** through memoization and caching
2. **Minimizing API call overhead** with batch processing
3. **Controlling execution frequency** using debounce and throttle mechanisms
4. **Tracking performance metrics** for continuous improvement
5. **Visualizing performance data** through a dedicated dashboard

## Key Features

### Memoization

The `memoize` function caches the results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations.

Key capabilities:
- Configurable cache size and maximum age
- Support for custom key generation
- Cache hit/miss tracking
- Automatic cache cleanup

### Batch Processing

The `createBatchProcessor` utility combines multiple similar API calls into batches to reduce network overhead.

Key capabilities:
- Configurable batch size and wait time
- Automatic batch processing based on queue size or time threshold
- Support for custom item identification
- Promise-based interface for seamless integration

### Performance Measurement

The `measureExecutionTime` utility wraps functions to track their execution time and other performance metrics.

Key capabilities:
- Automatic tracking of call count, execution time, and other metrics
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous functions
- Integration with the performance dashboard

### Debounce and Throttle

The `debounce` and `throttle` utilities control the execution frequency of functions to prevent performance degradation.

Key capabilities:
- Debounce: Delays execution until after a specified wait time
- Throttle: Limits execution to once per specified time period

## Usage Examples

### Memoization Example

```typescript
import { memoize } from '../api/utils/performanceOptimizations';

// Create a memoized version of an expensive function
const getMarketData = memoize(
  async (symbol: string) => {
    // Expensive API call or computation
    return await fetchMarketData(symbol);
  },
  {
    maxAgeMs: 60000, // Cache results for 1 minute
    maxCacheSize: 100, // Store up to 100 results
  }
);

// Use the memoized function
const data = await getMarketData('BTC-USD');
```

### Batch Processing Example

```typescript
import { createBatchProcessor } from '../api/utils/performanceOptimizations';

// Create a batch processor for price updates
const priceUpdateBatchProcessor = createBatchProcessor({
  maxBatchSize: 50, // Process up to 50 items at once
  maxWaitMs: 200, // Wait up to 200ms before processing
  processBatch: async (items) => {
    // Process all items in a single API call
    const results = await api.updatePrices(items);
    return results;
  }
});

// Add items to the batch
await priceUpdateBatchProcessor.add({ symbol: 'BTC-USD', price: 50000 });
```

### Performance Measurement Example

```typescript
import { measureExecutionTime } from '../api/utils/performanceOptimizations';

// Wrap a function to measure its performance
const getPortfolio = measureExecutionTime(
  async (userId: string) => {
    return await fetchPortfolio(userId);
  },
  'getPortfolio' // Name for metrics tracking
);

// Use the measured function
const portfolio = await getPortfolio('user123');
```

## Performance Dashboard

The Performance Dashboard provides real-time insights into the performance of your trading application. It tracks execution times, cache efficiency, and other metrics to help identify bottlenecks and optimize your trading experience.

### Key Metrics Displayed

- **Average Execution Time**: The average time it takes for a function to complete
- **Min/Max Execution Time**: The fastest and slowest recorded executions
- **Call Count**: How many times a function has been called
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of calls that were served from cache

### Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes at configurable intervals
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Sort by any metric and filter functions by name
- **Detailed Function Analysis**: Click on any function to see detailed metrics
- **Performance Recommendations**: Automatically generated optimization suggestions

## Best Practices

1. **Use Memoization Selectively**:
   - Ideal for pure functions with expensive computations
   - Consider cache invalidation needs when setting maxAgeMs
   - Monitor cache hit ratio to ensure effectiveness

2. **Batch Processing Guidelines**:
   - Balance batch size with latency requirements
   - Consider using smaller batches for time-sensitive operations
   - Implement error handling for partial batch failures

3. **Performance Measurement**:
   - Focus on measuring critical paths and potential bottlenecks
   - Use function names that clearly identify the operation
   - Regularly review the Performance Dashboard for insights

4. **Circuit Breaker Integration**:
   - Combine circuit breaker patterns with performance optimization
   - Use memoization for fallback data during circuit breaks
   - Track circuit breaker events in performance metrics
