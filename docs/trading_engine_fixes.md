# Trading Engine Fixes - April 7, 2025

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented to resolve test failures in the trading engine, specifically focusing on the `OrderManager` and `Portfolio` classes.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Position PnL Calculation
- **Problem**: `TypeError: Position.calculate_unrealized_pnl() missing 1 required positional argument: 'current_market_price'` when calling the method on newly created positions.
- **Solution**: Refactored the PnL calculation logic into a standalone function `calculate_position_pnl` that operates directly on Position objects, bypassing the instance method dispatch mechanism that was causing issues with newly created Pydantic objects.
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  def calculate_position_pnl(position: 'Position', current_market_price: float) -> None:
      """Calculates unrealized PnL for a given position object."""
      if position.quantity == 0:
          position.unrealized_pnl = 0.0
      elif position.side == 'long':
          position.unrealized_pnl = (current_market_price - position.entry_price) * position.quantity
      else: # Short position
          position.unrealized_pnl = (position.entry_price - current_market_price) * position.quantity
      position.last_update_time = utcnow()
  ```

### 2. Order Management Improvements
- **Parameter Name Mismatch**: Fixed parameter name mismatch in `Order.add_fill` method calls (changed `fill_qty` to `fill_quantity`).
- **Missing Property**: Added an `average_fill_price` property to the `Order` class that calls the existing `get_average_fill_price()` method.
  ```python
  @property
  def average_fill_price(self) -> Optional[float]:
      """Property that returns the average fill price."""
      return self.get_average_fill_price()
  ```
- **Finalized Orders Handling**: Modified behavior for finalized orders to not add fills to already finalized orders, matching test expectations.

### 3. Debugging and Logging
- Added detailed logging to track order fill processing and position updates.
- Improved error handling with more specific exception catching.

## Test Results
All 21 tests in `test_order_manager.py` now pass successfully, including:
- `test_cancel_partially_filled_order_success`
- `test_cancel_order_already_final_status`
- `test_process_trade_full_fill`
- `test_process_trade_partial_fill`
- `test_process_trade_multiple_fills`
- `test_process_trade_for_finalized_order`

## Next Steps
1. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove debug logging statements added during troubleshooting
   - Review and optimize the Portfolio and Position classes

2. **Additional Testing**
   - Add integration tests for the entire trading pipeline
   - Test edge cases for multi-asset portfolio management

3. **Feature Development**
   - Implement the `ExecutionHandler` to simulate trade execution
   - Develop the `PortfolioManager` logic
