The Virtual Trading Environment simulates trading without real capital to validate the system's performance before live deployment. It processes trade signals from the Decision Engine, simulates market execution, and provides comprehensive performance analytics to measure the system's effectiveness.

## Key Responsibilities

- Simulate trading with virtual balances and positions
- Process trade signals with realistic execution assumptions
- Track performance metrics including win rate and profitability
- Support backtesting against historical data
- Provide detailed analytics for system improvement
- Validate strategies across different market conditions

  "timestamp": 1645541585432,
  "balances": [
    {
      "asset": "USDT",
      "free": 9750.25,
      "locked": 1912.28
    },
    {
      "asset": "BTC",
      "free": 0.02,
      "locked": 0.0
    }

## Trade Simulation Model

The simulation models realistic trade execution:

### Entry Simulation

For limit orders:
- Order fills if price crosses the limit level
- Partial fills based on available liquidity
- Order expiration based on validity time
- Slippage model based on volatility and volume

For market orders:
- Immediate execution with slippage
- Average fill price calculation based on order book depth
- Realistic execution delay

### Exit Simulation

For take-profit and stop-loss:
- Automatic triggering when price crosses levels
- Slippage model based on order direction (more slippage on stops)
- Execution priority for stop-loss over take-profit
- Partial take-profit based on specified percentages

## Performance Metrics

The system calculates comprehensive performance metrics:

### Trade-Level Metrics

- Win/Loss: Binary outcome for each trade
- Profit/Loss: Absolute and percentage
- Hold Time: Duration of position
- Maximum Adverse Excursion: Largest drawdown during trade
- Maximum Favorable Excursion: Largest unrealized profit during trade

### Strategy-Level Metrics

- Win Rate: Percentage of winning trades
- Profit Factor: Gross profits divided by gross losses
- Average Win/Loss: Average profit vs. average loss
- Reward/Risk Ratio: Average win / average loss
- Expectancy: (Win Rate × Average Win) - (Loss Rate × Average Loss)

### Risk-Adjusted Metrics

- Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measurement
- Sortino Ratio: Downside risk-adjusted return
