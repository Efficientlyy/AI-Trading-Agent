**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

The Health Monitoring System (HMS) provides comprehensive real-time monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for the AI Trading Agent. It enables detection of component failures, performance degradation, and system-level issues while facilitating autonomous recovery actions.

This system is a critical component in achieving 100% autonomous operation by ensuring that the trading system can self-diagnose and recover from failures without human intervention.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

![Health Monitoring System Architecture](https://placeholder-for-diagram.com/health-system-architecture.png)

#### 2.1.1 HealthMonitor

The central component that orchestrates the entire health monitoring system:

- Manages registrations of components to be monitored
- Coordinates health checks and aggregates health status data
- Detects system-wide issues that span multiple components
- Triggers alerts and recovery actions when necessary
- Provides a query interface for current health status

#### 2.1.2 ComponentHealth

Represents the health status of an individual system component:

- Tracks component liveness via heartbeats
- Monitors component-specific metrics
- Maintains historical health data for trend analysis
- Provides component-level diagnostics
- Supports custom health check implementations

#### 2.1.3 HealthMetrics

Collection of data structures for performance metrics:

- Standard metrics (CPU, memory, response time)
- Trading-specific metrics (order processing time, data latency)
- Custom component-specific metrics
- Time-series data for trend analysis
- Threshold configurations for alerting

#### 2.1.4 HeartbeatManager

Manages the heartbeat mechanism for detecting component liveness:

- Receives periodic signals from components
- Detects missing heartbeats and raises alerts
- Configurable tolerance for timing variations
- Supports different heartbeat frequencies for different components
- Integrates with system clock for accurate timing

#### 2.1.5 AlertManager

Handles the generation and distribution of health alerts:

- Configurable alert levels (info, warning, critical)
- Alert routing to appropriate channels
- Alert aggregation to prevent alert storms
- Integration with external notification systems
- Alert history and acknowledgment tracking

#### 2.1.6 RecoveryCoordinator

Coordinates automated recovery actions:

- Integrates with the Enhanced Circuit Breaker system
- Implements recovery strategies for different failure scenarios
- Manages recovery attempts and escalation
- Tracks recovery success/failure metrics
- Provides feedback for improving recovery strategies

### 2.2 Integration Points

#### 2.2.1 Trading Orchestrator Integration

- Health checks integrated with orchestrator lifecycle events
- Component status reporting from orchestrator to health monitor
- Recovery actions triggered by health monitor to orchestrator
- Performance metrics collected during trading operations

#### 2.2.2 Enhanced Circuit Breaker Integration

- Circuit breaker states inform component health assessment
- Health monitor can trigger circuit breaker operations
- Coordinated recovery strategies between systems
- Shared metrics and diagnostics data

#### 2.2.3 Dashboard Integration

- Real-time health status visualization on dashboard
- Component status indicators with drill-down details
- Performance metrics graphing and trending
- Alert visualization and management
- Recovery action tracking and status

#### 2.2.4 Metrics Collection System Integration

- Standardized metrics format compatible with Prometheus/Grafana
- Export interfaces for metrics data
- Integration with time-series databases
- Support for metrics aggregation and analysis

## 8. Considerations and Risks

### 8.1 Scalability Considerations

- The health monitoring system must scale with the number of components
- Metrics collection can become a bottleneck with many components
- Alert processing must handle alert storms during system-wide issues
- Recovery coordination must prioritize critical components

### 8.2 Potential Risks

- False positives in health detection causing unnecessary recoveries
- Excessive overhead from too-frequent health checks
- Recovery actions causing cascading failures
- Alert fatigue from too many notifications
- Health monitoring system itself requiring monitoring

### 8.3 Mitigation Strategies

- Implement configurable thresholds with hysteresis
- Use adaptive sampling rates based on system load
- Design recovery actions with safety checks and rollbacks
- Implement alert aggregation and throttling
- Make health monitoring components self-healing
