## Component Interactions

### Data Flow

1. **Data Collection → Impact Factor Analysis**: Raw market data flows from exchanges to the Impact Factor Analysis Engine for processing
2. **Impact Factor Analysis → Analysis Agents**: Processed market data and factor measurements are provided to specialized agents
3. **Analysis Agents → Decision Engine**: Predictions with confidence scores flow to the Decision Engine
4. **Decision Engine → Virtual Trading**: Trade signals are sent to the Virtual Trading Environment for execution or simulation
5. **Virtual Trading → Decision Engine**: Trade execution confirmations and performance metrics flow back to the Decision Engine

### Event Communication

The system uses an event-driven architecture with the following event types:

- **MarketDataEvent**: Real-time and historical market data
- **FactorCalculationEvent**: Factor values and impact measurements
- **PredictionEvent**: Agent predictions with confidence scores
- **TradeSignalEvent**: Complete trade instructions with rationale
- **TradeExecutionEvent**: Execution confirmations with details
- **SystemStatusEvent**: Component health and performance metrics
- **ConfigurationEvent**: System configuration changes
- **NotificationEvent**: User-facing alerts and messages

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Modularity and Separation of Concerns

Each component has a well-defined responsibility and communicates with other components through standardized interfaces. This enables:

- Independent development and testing
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Ability to replace or upgrade individual components

### 2. Event-Driven Communication

Components communicate primarily through events, which:

- Reduces tight coupling between components
- Enables asynchronous processing
- Improves system scalability
- Simplifies component testing with event mocking

### 3. Comprehensive Logging

All system activities are extensively logged, with:

- Structured log formats for machine analysis
- Detailed attribution of decisions to factors
- Performance tracking for all predictions
- Complete audit trails for all actions

### 4. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

The system is designed to handle failures gracefully:

- Components can restart independently
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### 5. Security by Design

Security considerations are built into the architecture:

- Proper authentication and authorization
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Input validation at all boundaries
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python 3.10+ for most components, Rust for execution engine
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- **Message Broker**: Redis for event distribution
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for API endpoints, React for dashboard frontend
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

### Key Libraries

- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn for statistical analysis
- **WebSocket**: websockets for real-time data connections
- **API Clients**: aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests
- **Messaging**: Redis pub/sub for event distribution
- **Visualization**: Plotly/Chart.js for dashboard visualizations

## Configuration Management

The system uses a layered configuration approach:

1. **Default configuration**: Built-in defaults for all components
2. **Environment configuration**: Environment-specific overrides
3. **User configuration**: User-customizable settings
4. **Runtime configuration**: Dynamic configuration changes during operation

Configuration is stored in YAML format and validated against schemas to ensure correctness.

## Deployment Considerations

The system is designed to support different deployment models:

- **Development**: Local deployment for development and testing
- **Simulation**: Full system deployment with virtual trading
- **Production**: Live deployment with real trading capabilities

Containers are used to ensure consistent environments across deployments.
