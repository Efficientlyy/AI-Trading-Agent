   - Topic modeling using LDA or BERTopic

3. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**
   - Time-series analysis of event sequences
   - Lag correlation analysis
   - Seasonal pattern detection

4. **Graph Algorithms**
   - PageRank for identifying influential events
   - Community detection (Louvain method)
   - Shortest path analysis for causal chains
   - Centrality measures (betweenness, eigenvector)

5. **Market Impact Prediction**
   - Historical correlation analysis
   - Event-impact mapping

# Initialize the engine
connection_engine = ConnectionEngine()
await connection_engine.initialize()

# Add events from different sources
events = await connection_engine.collect_recent_events(
    timeframe="24h",
    sources=["news", "social_media", "geopolitical"]
)

# Analyze relationships
relationship_graph = await connection_engine.analyze_relationships(events)

# Identify key events
key_events = connection_engine.identify_central_events(relationship_graph, top_n=5)
print("Most influential events:")
for event in key_events:
    print(f"- {event['description']} (Centrality: {event['centrality']:.2f})")
