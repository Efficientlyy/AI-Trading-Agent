# AI Trading Agent - Development Plan

## Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered trading agent for algorithmic trading, featuring a modular architecture with components for data acquisition, trading engine, strategy development, and backtesting.

## Recent Progress

### Trading Engine Fixes (April 7, 2025)
We successfully resolved several critical issues in the trading engine:

1. **Fixed Position PnL Calculation**
   - Refactored the unrealized PnL calculation logic into a standalone function `calculate_position_pnl`
   - Eliminated the TypeError related to Position.calculate_unrealized_pnl method
   - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging

2. **Order Management Improvements**
   - Fixed parameter name mismatches in Order.add_fill method calls
   - Added an `average_fill_price` property to the Order class
   - Modified behavior for finalized orders to match test expectations

3. **Test Suite**
   - All 21 tests in test_order_manager.py now pass successfully
   - Improved test coverage for edge cases like partially filled orders and finalized orders

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove debug logging statements added during troubleshooting
   - Review and optimize the Portfolio and Position classes
   - Improve documentation for key methods

2. **Additional Testing**
   - Add integration tests for the entire trading pipeline
   - Implement stress tests for high-frequency trading scenarios
   - Test edge cases for multi-asset portfolio management

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize position and portfolio updates for large portfolios
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Strategy Development**
   - Implement basic technical analysis strategies
   - Add machine learning model integration
   - Develop risk management components

2. **Backtesting Framework**
   - Enhance the backtesting engine with more realistic market conditions
   - Add transaction cost modeling
   - Implement performance metrics and reporting

3. **Data Pipeline**
   - Expand data sources for market data
   - Implement real-time data processing
   - Add feature engineering capabilities

### Long-term Vision
1. **Production Deployment**
   - Develop monitoring and alerting systems
   - Implement failover and recovery mechanisms
   - Create a dashboard for performance tracking

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-market trading capabilities
   - Portfolio optimization algorithms
   - Sentiment analysis integration

## Architecture
The system is built with a modular architecture:

- **Data Acquisition**: Fetches and processes market data
- **Trading Engine**: Manages orders, positions, and portfolio
- **Strategy Layer**: Implements trading algorithms
- **Backtesting Framework**: Simulates trading strategies on historical data
- **Risk Management**: Controls exposure and implements safeguards
