# Test Run Results and Observations

## Test Environment
- **Date**: June 4, 2025
- **Duration**: ~85 seconds (terminated early due to issues)
- **Mode**: Paper trading with real data
- **Trading Pairs**: BTCUSDC, ETHUSDC

## Initialization Status
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Environment variables and API keys configured correctly
- ✅ Paper trading enabled and configured properly
- ✅ Trading pairs enabled: BTCUSDC, ETHUSDC
- ✅ System initialized and started successfully

## Runtime Observations
- ✅ System started and entered main trading loop
- ✅ Current trading session detected: US
- ✅ Market state update loop started
- ✅ Signal generator started for configured symbols
- ❌ No signals generated during the test period
- ❌ No orders placed during the test period
- ❌ No changes to paper trading balances

## Issues Identified
1. **Primary Issue**: Persistent warnings about type mismatch in signal processing:
   ```
   WARNING - Expected dict for safe_get_nested, got <class 'flash_trading_signals.FlashTradingSignals'>
   ```
   This indicates a logic error in the code that's preventing proper signal generation.

2. **Consequence**: The system is running but not generating any trading signals or orders, which means it's not performing its core function.

## Technical Analysis
The error suggests that somewhere in the code, the `safe_get_nested` function is being called with a `FlashTradingSignals` object instead of a dictionary. This is likely happening in one of these scenarios:

1. The signal generator is not properly returning signal data in the expected format
2. There's a type mismatch in how signals are being processed or accessed
3. The API connection might be failing to retrieve market data needed for signal generation

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Code Fix**: Examine and fix the type mismatch in the signal generation logic:
   - Check how `safe_get_nested` is being used with the signal generator
   - Ensure the signal generator is returning data in the expected format
   - Add proper type checking before calling `safe_get_nested`

2. **API Validation**: Verify that the MEXC API is responding correctly:
   - Test direct API calls to confirm market data can be retrieved
   - Check for rate limiting or authentication issues

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed logging to trace the data flow:
   - Log the actual data being received from the API
   - Log the structure of objects before they're passed to problematic functions

4. **Alternative Test**: Try running with mock data to isolate if the issue is with the API connection or the internal logic
