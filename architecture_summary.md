- **Technical Indicators**: Calculation of standard and advanced technical indicators
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detection of chart patterns and market anomalies

### 3. Signal Generation Layer
- **FlashTradingSignals**: Base signal generation with order book imbalance and momentum analysis
- **EnhancedFlashTradingSignals**: Advanced multi-timeframe signal generation with technical indicators
- **Session-Aware Parameters**: Dynamic adjustment of signal thresholds based on global trading sessions

### 4. Decision Making Layer
- **LLM Strategic Overseer**: AI-powered strategic decision making with tiered LLM approach
- **Context Management**: Maintenance of market context, trading history, and performance metrics
- **Risk Parameter Management**: Dynamic adjustment of risk parameters based on market conditions

### 5. Execution Layer
- **Paper Trading System**: Simulation of trading with real market data but no financial risk
- **Flash Trading System**: Integration of all components for end-to-end operation
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing, stop-loss management, and drawdown control

### 6. Visualization Layer
- **Dashboard UI**: User interface for system monitoring and control
- **Chart Components**: Advanced charting with pattern markers and signal indicators
- **Performance Metrics**: Visualization of trading performance and system health

## Core Components

### Trading System Core

The core trading functionality is implemented through several key components:

1. **Flash Trading System** (`flash_trading.py`):
   - Main integration module that coordinates all components
   - Manages the trading loop, signal processing, and execution
   - Handles configuration, logging, and error management

2. **Optimized MEXC Client** (`optimized_mexc_client.py`):
   - High-performance API client with connection pooling and caching
   - Comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
   - Market data retrieval and order management

3. **Paper Trading System** (`paper_trading.py`):
   - Simulates trading with real market data but no financial risk
   - Maintains virtual balances and positions
   - Applies realistic slippage and partial fills

### Signal Generation and Analysis

The signal generation and analysis subsystem includes:

1. **Flash Trading Signals** (`flash_trading_signals.py`):
   - Real-time market state tracking and signal generation
   - Order book imbalance, momentum, and volatility analysis
   - Session-aware parameter adjustment

2. **Enhanced Flash Trading Signals** (`enhanced_flash_trading_signals.py`):
   - Multi-timeframe analysis and technical indicators
   - Advanced pattern recognition and signal confirmation
   - Liquidity analysis and slippage estimation

3. **Pattern Recognition** (`llm_overseer/analysis/pattern_recognition.py`):
   - Chart pattern detection (double tops/bottoms, head and shoulders, etc.)
   - Technical indicator calculation and signal generation
   - Event-based notification of detected patterns

### AI and Decision Making

The AI and decision making subsystem includes:

1. **LLM Strategic Overseer** (`llm_overseer/main.py`):
   - Tiered LLM approach for cost-effective decision making
   - Context management for market data and trading history
   - Strategic decision making and risk parameter adjustment

2. **Context Manager** (`llm_overseer/core/context_manager.py`):
   - Maintenance of market context and trading history
   - Relevant context extraction for LLM prompts
   - Context updating based on market events

3. **Trading Session Manager** (`trading_session_manager.py`):
   - Identification of global trading sessions (Asia, Europe, US)
   - Session-specific parameter adjustment
   - Time-based strategy optimization

## Data Flow and Workflow

The system implements a sophisticated data flow and workflow:

### 1. Initialization Flow
- System loads configuration from `flash_trading_config.json`
- Environment variables loaded from `.env-secure/.env`
- Components initialized in dependency order
- WebSocket connections established for real-time data

### 2. Market Data Flow
- Real-time order book and trade data collected via REST API and WebSockets
- Data normalized, validated, and cached
- Market states updated with latest data
- Technical indicators calculated across multiple timeframes

### 3. Signal Generation Flow
- Market data analyzed for patterns and anomalies
- Signals generated based on configurable thresholds
- Signals filtered and aggregated across timeframes
- Signal strength calculated for position sizing

### 4. Decision Making Flow
- Signals transformed into trading decisions
- LLM consulted for strategic decisions with context
- Risk parameters adjusted based on market conditions
- Final decisions passed to execution layer

### 5. Execution Flow
- Trading decisions executed via paper trading
- Orders placed with appropriate parameters
- Open orders monitored and processed
- Trade history and performance tracked

### 6. Monitoring and Reporting Flow
- System status and performance continuously monitored
- Visualization components updated with latest data
- Notifications sent via Telegram for significant events
- Performance reports generated on demand

## Integration Points

The system includes several key integration points:

1. **MEXC Exchange API**: Primary source of market data and execution
2. **Telegram Integration**: Command interface and notifications
3. **LLM Integration**: Strategic decision making via OpenRouter
4. **Visualization Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring and control

## Technical Features
