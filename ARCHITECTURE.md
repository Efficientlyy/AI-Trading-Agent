# AI Crypto Trading System Architecture

*Last Updated: March 3, 2025*

This document serves as a central reference for the system design and development of our AI Crypto Trading System. It outlines the key architectural components, their current implementation status, and the roadmap for future development.

## System Overview

The AI Crypto Trading System is designed as a modular, extensible platform for algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency markets. The system is organized in a layered architecture, with clear separation of concerns between data acquisition, strategy development, backtesting, portfolio management, and trade execution.

## Next Implementation Priorities

1. Risk Management Enhancements
2. Real-time Data Streaming
3. Execution Algorithms
4. Machine Learning Strategy Framework
5. Web Dashboard for Monitoring

## Current Sprint Accomplishments

- Refactored backtesting framework to a modular design
- Implemented multiple strategy types (MA, RSI, MACD, Multi-strategy)
- Added volatility-based position sizing
- Added market regime detection
- Implemented parameter optimization
- Enhanced risk management features (stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stop)
- Improved visualization and reporting

## Known Issues

- Exchange API integration needs error handling improvements
- Optimization process can be slow for large parameter spaces
- Backtesting assumes perfect execution without slippage
