# AI Crypto Trading System Architecture

*Last Updated: March 24, 2025*

This document serves as a central reference for the system design and development of our AI Crypto Trading System. It outlines the key architectural components, their current implementation status, and the roadmap for future development.

## System Overview

The AI Crypto Trading System is designed as a modular, extensible platform for algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency markets. The system is organized in a layered architecture, with clear separation of concerns between data acquisition, strategy development, backtesting, portfolio management, and trade execution.

**Core Design Philosophy**: A fully automated multi-agent trading system where specialized agents collaborate to detect market regimes, generate signals, manage risk, and execute trades with minimal human intervention.

### Key Components

1. **SentimentRegimeDetector**: Detects market regimes based on sentiment data:
   - Implements the abstract BaseRegimeDetector interface
   - Leverages the SentimentAnalysisManager to fetch and process sentiment data
   - Classifies markets into five sentiment-based regimes (Fearful, Anxious, Neutral, Optimistic, Euphoric)
   - Implements proper hysteresis to prevent regime flickering
   - Uses smoothing via exponential moving averages
   - Provides both discrete regime classification and probability distributions

2. **Factory Integration**:
   - Registered with the RegimeDetectorFactory using standardized registration
   - Accessible through the unified factory API
   - Supports dynamic loading to avoid circular dependencies
   - Includes configuration validation and sensible defaults

3. **Ensemble Approach**:
   - Integrates with the EnsembleRegimeDetector as a component detector
   - Contributes weighted sentiment signals to ensemble decisions
   - Leverages adaptive weighting based on historical performance

### Benefits & Design Considerations

- **Modular Design**: Follows single responsibility principle, with clear boundaries between components
- **Extensibility**: Easily extended to incorporate new sentiment data sources
- **Performance**: Optimized for efficient processing of large datasets
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with synthetic and historical data
- **Hysteresis**: Implements regime smoothing to prevent noise-driven transitions
- **Probability Output**: Provides probabilistic regime assessments, not just discrete classifications

This implementation enhances our regime detection capabilities by incorporating sentiment signals that often precede price movements, allowing for earlier detection of regime transitions than purely price-based indicators.
